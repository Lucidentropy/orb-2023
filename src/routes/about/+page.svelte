    <h1>About Orb</h1>
    <p>The clan was founded in the Summer of 2000, based on the simple premise that players could come together and just
        have fun time playing a game of Tribes. Tired of rude or too serious (sometimes both) clans, we agreed that the
        game Tribes is only a game, not a job. Orb was created by just 4 members, Lucid (at the time known as Raven),
        Cells (in rpgs as Ahmetal), Doom Train (also known as Tomb), and Vorax-1. Of these founding members, Lucid and
        Cells remain.</p>
    <p>Clan Orb has since evolved into more of a selective gaming community. Our players span the globe, and have a
        presence in a variety of games. While our origins are in mod 'Shifter' for Tribes, there are quite a few games
        Orb members play in, in several different genres. Many Orb members have even met, changing the relationship from
        online clan mates to more of actual friends. In the forums we're a relaxed (and more often then not, downright
        goofy) bunch of gamers.</p>
    <p>Be sure to bear in mind as you read this, that a lot of this refers to various games with you may not be familiar
        with. This page tries to be general but oftentimes game specific references are made.</p>
    <h2 class="about_header">The &nbsp;Orb philosophy is simple.</h2>
    <p>If you you're looking to learn anything about Orb, the most important aspect of our clan is understanding our
        ideal, our philosophy. Orb is about enhancing the game experience shared with friends. We beleive that there is
        real life in one hand, and online life in the other. Our goal is to make online life a fun and rewarding
        experience without infringing on real life. We want enjoyable and sometimes outrageous game experiences to be
        the norm, so when we share our stories, others say “Only in orb would you see that!”. We also aim to make an
        impact on the gamers we come in contact with; We want to leave a server, regardless of the game, and have
        something say “Man, those Orb guys are a ton of fun to play with”. We want others to see us as respectful,
        funny, mature, and fun to be around. One of the core principles in what it is to be part of the Orb community is
        understanding the balance between maturity and fun. We want clan members to be proud of the tag, proud of the
        name, and feel like it represents their friends, their humor, and their way of online life regardless if their
        name is at the top or the bottom of the scoreboard.</p>
    <h2 class="about_header">So, what are the rules?</h2>
    <p>Orb does not have a point-by-point rule list. If you have been invited to Orb, you already have the natural
        traits which we'd be setting rules for, and therefore defining rules are mostly unnecessary.</p>
    <h2 class="about_header">What is so special about Orb?</h2>
    <p>Orb has lasted for over a decade with little turnover because we value the real-life character of people, not the
        online character. In fact, many of us have gone on to meet other Orb members offline.&nbsp;Many Orb members are
        in Orb with their friends and enjoy playing games within the same community. It's as simple as that.</p>
    <h2>What does Orb or <span>{orb}</span> mean?</h2>
    <p>Orb stands for Orville RedenBacher. We really like popcorn. Just kidding. When I was considering founding Orb,
        player names were filled with 3 letter acronyms, often meaning some, for lack of better words, lame things (e.x.
        x-=SPK=-x for Super Pro Killers). I wanted something that sounded cool, was short, and didn't have some sort of
        'l33t' meaning. &nbsp;While I was trying to buck the trend of silly acronym guild names, I did want some sort of
        symbolic tag, I didn't like the look of plain characters such as “orb.Lucid” (although I use this in
        games/systems that don't allow special characters). So I came up with { orb } at random. It looks a little cooler
        in the font used by Tribes. It eventually evolved into people calling us the Tie Fighter clan.</p>
